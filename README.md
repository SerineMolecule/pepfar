In-progress work for the pepfar essay site.

This is several things:

- an in-progress version of the pepfar essay
- some CSS and JS to make an essay super readable (dark mode, heading nav,
  sidenote-style footnotes)
- a conversion script from Google Docs to aforementioned essay format

I don't think I ever saw an off-the-shelf solution that makes some text
maximally readable. I'm a person who is kinda NIH about things, because
for a lot of these things it's easier to rewrite than to take an existing
solution and customize it for my needs, and it also ends up a lot more
lightweight, too! Who needs React when I can make tooltips in 50 lines
of vanilla JS?

So yeah, vanilla JS, optimized very much for an absolutely tiny download.
(Ignore the images, I'll optimize them later.) If you want to host your own
essays, this is probably not a bad starting point.
